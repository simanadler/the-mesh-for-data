While we haven&amp;rsquo;t set an official roadmap, some planned key features are:
Multicluster support Secure comminication between control plane components (using Istio) Secure secret management: ensure secrets are only observed by services that are authorized to view them Isolation: ensure that no service is communication with an unauthorized party Modules for write-path: validate that exported data is in compliance with policies Istio-based blueprint: A typical blueprint to be supported in the near future would be composed of an Istio gateway to police egress traffic from the services running in the blurprint.</description></item></channel></rss>
